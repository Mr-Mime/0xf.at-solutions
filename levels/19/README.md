Similiar to level 17 I created a dictionary with the value for each character.
To makes things easier I only entered lower case characters and converted to input to an all lower case string.  

Then I iterate through the input and check for every char wether it is an actual character of the alphabet or already a number.  
For the characters I look up the value in the created dictionary, for numbers I just convert them.
Everything is summed up and printed out at the end.
