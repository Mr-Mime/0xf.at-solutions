This level uses base64 encoding / decoding.
As the entered password will be encoded, we need to know the decoded form of the given string `YjhkYzQxZWRkNzBhNDg0ZGY5NjkyNzIwOQ==`.
And thats what the script is doing, it takes one argument and prints the base64 decoded equivalent.

```
solution.py YjhkYzQxZWRkNzBhNDg0ZGY5NjkyNzIwOQ==
