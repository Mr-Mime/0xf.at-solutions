By testing various strings it is clear, that the encrypt function shifts the character based on its postion.

The first character will be the same, the second will be shifted one to the right.
A would become B, B would become C and so on.

The solution script takes an string as an argument an shifts each character to the left based on its position.
Thus the encryption will be reversed an we get the original string.
