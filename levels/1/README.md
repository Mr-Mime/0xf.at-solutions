To find the solution we need to open the developer console of the browser and find the password input field element.
We see that the "OK" button calls the `checkPW()` function, which can be found in the `<script>` tag some lines below.

The `checkPW()` function simply checkes wether the passwords equals "tooeasy".
Thus if we enter "tooeasy" and press "OK" the level is solved.
